# Manage DB connection in Windows Service

Working with Windows Services in .NET and managing Oracle database connections with multiple threads can indeed be a bit tricky, but let's break it down to make it manageable. When dealing with database connections in a multi-threaded environment like a Windows Service, there are a few key principles you'll want to follow to ensure smooth operation:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Fortunately, Oracle's .NET data provider (ODP.NET) supports connection pooling out of the box. This means it automatically manages a pool of connections for you, which can significantly reduce the overhead of opening and closing connections, especially in a multi-threaded application. Make sure connection pooling is enabled in your connection string (it's enabled by default).

2. **Using Connections Efficiently**: Even with connection pooling, it's crucial to use connections efficiently. Open a connection as late as possible and close it as early as possible. In the context of a Windows Service, ensure that each thread that needs database access gets a connection, performs its work, and then closes the connection promptly.

3. **Exception Handling and Reconnection Logic**: In a service that's always running, you'll inevitably encounter transient failures (like temporary network issues). Implement robust exception handling around your database operations. If a connection fails, you should have logic to retry the connection. Implementing a backoff strategy (where the time between retries increases gradually) can also be beneficial to avoid overwhelming the database or network.

4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure that your code that interacts with the database is thread-safe. Avoid sharing Oracle connection instances between threads. Instead, let each thread request its own connection from the pool.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate these principles. Note that this example assumes you're using ODP.NET for Oracle database access:

```csharp
using System;
using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client;

public class DatabaseAccess
{
    private string _connectionString = "User Id=userid;Password=password;Data Source=datasource;Pooling=true;";

    public void PerformDatabaseOperation()
    {
        try
        {
            using (OracleConnection conn = new OracleConnection(_connectionString))
            {
                conn.Open();
                // Perform your database operations here
            }
        }
        catch (OracleException ex)
        {
            // Log exception
            // Implement your retry logic here
            // Consider using exponential backoff for retries
        }
    }
}
```

For a Windows Service with multiple threads, you'd typically have each thread that needs to perform database operations call `PerformDatabaseOperation` or a similar method designed for the specific work it needs to do.

Remember, the key to smooth operation is efficient and safe use of connections, proper error handling, and effective use of Oracle's connection pooling. Adjust the retry logic and connection handling based on your application's specific needs and the reliability of your network and database server.

## Retry logic

Implementing retry logic for database operations, especially in a Windows Service that interacts with an Oracle database, is crucial for handling transient errors gracefully. A simple yet effective approach is to use a combination of exponential backoff and retry limit. This means you wait longer between each retry attempt, and you limit the number of retries to avoid endless loops.

Here's how you can implement such a retry logic in C#:

1. **Define Retry Policy**: Decide on the maximum number of retries and the initial delay. The delay typically increases exponentially between retries.
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement exponential backoff by increasing the delay between retries in an exponential manner. This helps to prevent overwhelming the database or network.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure you're only retrying for transient errors. Oracle exceptions can be inspected to determine if an error is transient (like network issues, timeouts, etc.).

Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client;

public class DatabaseRetryLogic
{
    private string _connectionString = "User Id=userid;Password=password;Data Source=datasource;Pooling=true;";

    public void PerformDatabaseOperationWithRetry()
    {
        int retryCount = 0;
        int maxRetries = 3;
        TimeSpan delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2);

        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                using (OracleConnection conn = new OracleConnection(_connectionString))
                {
                    conn.Open();
                    // Perform your database operations here
                    break; // Success! Exit the loop.
                }
            }
            catch (OracleException ex)
            {
                retryCount++;
                if (retryCount > maxRetries || !IsTransientError(ex))
                {
                    // Log the exception
                    throw; // Rethrow exception or handle it as needed
                }

                // Log the retry attempt
                Thread.Sleep(delay);
                delay = delay * 2; // Exponential backoff
            }
        }
    }

    private bool IsTransientError(OracleException ex)
    {
        // Add logic to determine if the error is transient
        // This is a simplistic example. You'll need to adjust based on actual transient errors you encounter.
        return ex.Number == 12541 || ex.Number == 12170;
    }
}
```

In this example, `PerformDatabaseOperationWithRetry` attempts to perform a database operation, with retry logic for handling transient errors. The `IsTransientError` method is a placeholder where you'd add logic to determine if an Oracle exception is considered transient, based on its error number or other properties.

Remember, the specifics of what constitutes a transient error can vary based on your Oracle database setup, the network environment, and the nature of the operations your service is performing. You may need to adjust the logic based on the errors you're encountering in your specific context.

# Entity Framwork (.Net Framework 4.8)

When working with a Windows Service implemented in .NET Framework 4.8 and wanting to use Entity Framework (EF) for database operations, including implementing retry logic for Oracle database connections, the approach slightly differs from .NET Core/EF Core since EF Core's built-in retry mechanism isn't directly available in Entity Framework 6 (EF6) or earlier versions. However, you can still achieve a robust solution with a bit of custom implementation.

### Step 1: Configuring DbContext with Oracle Database

Firstly, ensure you have the correct Oracle provider for Entity Framework in your .NET Framework project. Oracle offers the official `Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.EntityFramework` NuGet package that works with Entity Framework 6.

You can configure your `DbContext` in a similar way, but the configuration will be slightly different compared to EF Core. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might configure your `DbContext`:

```csharp
using System.Data.Entity;
using Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client;
// Other using directives as needed

public class YourDbContext : DbContext
{
    public YourDbContext() : base(new OracleConnection("User Id=userid; Password=password; Data Source=datasource;"), true)
    {
        // Configuration settings like lazy loading, proxy creation etc.
    }
    
    // DbSets and model configuration
}
```

### Step 2: Implementing Retry Logic in .NET Framework

Since EF6 does not have the same built-in support for automatic retries on transient errors, you will need to implement retry logic manually. One common approach is to create a helper method that encapsulates the retry logic and wraps your database operations. Here's a simplified version of how you could implement it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
using System.Data.Entity.SqlServer;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public static class RetryHelper
{
    public static TResult ExecuteWithRetry<TResult>(Func<TResult> operation, int maxAttempts = 3, int delayMilliseconds = 1000)
    {
        var attempts = 0;
        
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                return operation();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                if (++attempts >= maxAttempts || !IsTransient(ex))
                    throw;
                
                Task.Delay(delayMilliseconds).Wait(); // Wait before retrying
                delayMilliseconds *= 2; // Increase delay for next attempt
            }
        }
    }

    private static bool IsTransient(Exception ex)
    {
        // Check if the exception is considered transient
        // This could be expanded based on the specific exceptions Oracle throws that are considered transient
        return ex is TimeoutException || (ex is SqlException && IsTransientSqlException(ex as SqlException));
    }

    private static bool IsTransientSqlException(SqlException ex)
    {
        // Here you'd check the SQL exception number to determine if it's considered transient
        // Refer to Oracle / SQL Server documentation for numbers indicating transient faults
        return false; // Simplified; actual implementation needed based on Oracle error codes
    }
}
```

### Using the Retry Logic

You can use the `ExecuteWithRetry` method to wrap any database operation. For example:

```csharp
var result = RetryHelper.ExecuteWithRetry(() => 
{
    using (var context = new YourDbContext())
    {
        // Perform database operations
        return context.Employees.ToList();
    }
});
```

### Important Considerations

- **Transient Error Identification**: Properly identifying transient errors specific to Oracle databases is crucial. You need to adjust the `IsTransient` and `IsTransientSqlException` methods to correctly identify and handle Oracle's transient exceptions.
- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**: The example provided is synchronous for simplicity. Depending on your application's requirements, you may need to implement an asynchronous version of the retry logic.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling and logging around your retry logic to diagnose issues in production environments effectively.

By manually implementing and utilizing such retry logic, your .NET Framework-based Windows Service can more reliably handle transient database connection issues with Oracle.

# Final solution

It occured that Entity Framwork handles connection pretty well. I discovered that problem was that it worked as a infinite loop and there was catch on Oracle and Enity exceptions. Unhandled exception was stopping loop of a service that was connecting and fetching data from Oracle.
