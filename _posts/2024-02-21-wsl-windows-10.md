# Step by instruction how to set up Jekyll on WSL

I have installed WSL from Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features On Or Off. 
Problem was that it installs WSL 1. When later I have configured Visual Studio Code, it was complaining about older version. I was not able to switch to WSL 2 just by installing new version. I had no choice to reinstall everything. 

My step by step:

1. Install WSL 1 from Control Panel -> Progrsms -> Turn Windows Features On Or Off.
2. Install WSL 2 from Microsoft Store.
3. When installed you may install Ubuntu or other distro from Microsoft Store. I have installed it: ```
wsl --install Ubuntu-22.04
```
